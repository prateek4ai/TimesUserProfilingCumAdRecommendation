## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
pip install times-ctr-optimizer

text

### Basic Usage
import times_ctr_optimizer

Initialize the CTR optimization system
optimizer = times_ctr_optimizer.CTROptimizer()

Run complete demo with realistic data
results = optimizer.quick_demo()

print(f"🎯 CTR Performance: {results['ctr']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"💰 Revenue Integration: {results['sponsored_ratio']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"📊 Events Generated: {len(results['events']):,}")

text

### Advanced Usage
Generate large-scale synthetic dataset
events, items = optimizer.generate_data(
n_users=100000,
n_items=50000,
n_events=1000000
)

Build feature engineering pipeline
user_features, item_features = optimizer.build_features(events, items)

print(f"✅ Generated {len(events):,} realistic events")
print(f"✅ Built features for {len(user_features):,} users")
